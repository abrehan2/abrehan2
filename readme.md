ABOUT ME
</h1>	
 
<p align="left"><b>Greetings, fellow developers! I am a third-year software engineering student pursuing MERN stack development. I have always been passionate about web development and its related tools. Throughout my learning process, I have always preferred developing custom projects utilizing recommended industrial practices and software development approaches. Crafting ideas into web-based realities has always fascinated me, and I strive to deliver beyond the constraints. I started practicing and gaining hands-on experience since 2021, which includes multiple internships at different organizations. Moreover, I am a Meta and LinkedIn certified MERN stack developer, having obtained certifications from these organizations. I have always believed that rushing to learn is a waste, instead of practicing what has been learned.</b><p/>
