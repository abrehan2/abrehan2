ABOUT ME

Hello 👋, I'm Rehan, a Software Engineer focused on building scalable software, writing web-related articles, and releasing content on Web Technologies at @webros.tech 🚀

Ever since I was a little kid, web-based applications have fascinated me because of how they are planned, designed, implemented, tested, and maintained. While many people find books to be their first love for finding solutions, it wasn't the same for me. I have always relished reading various perspectives in articles and implementing different approaches from YouTube tutorials, which have helped me climb many stairs towards improvement.

In 2023, I became a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, a worldwide community of campus influencers driven to assist their peers and cultivate thriving technology ecosystems. Buying premium courses in Pakistan has been a significant challenge for someone belonging to a middle-class family. This motivated me to build a regional community of over 700 people focused on Web Development from different colors, castes, and creeds. I aim to solve this problem by hosting workshops and bootcamps, and to date, I have hosted 30+ workshops.

During my time at university, I always sought ways to use Visual Studio Code during classes. I was the winner of CodeAir, a flagship competitive coding competition held at the university by Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA), among 40+ teams from different universities. Furthermore, I was invited to host a workshop for AI students on 'GitHub - Your Portal to Open Source Excellence' at LTC Hall. Additionally, I served as a Developer Lead in my university's MLSA chapter, where I managed a team of eight people involved in integrating features, carrying out versions, and making updates quickly for each MLSA event. Moreover, I was a Web Development mentor in Developers League, a two-month bootcamp organized by MLSA. I was tasked with conducting workshops on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for juniors to make them aware of different paths to pursue. 

I have released two npm packages: 'use-countries-hook', built with React.js, and 'geospatial-toolkit', built with Node.js. Each carries a distinct purpose and contributes to the developer community. 

My expertise: </br>

• 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁-𝗘𝗻𝗱: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, React.js, Redux, Next.js, and Zustand </br>
