ABOUT ME
</h1>	
 
<p align="left"><b>Greetings, fellow developers! I am a third-year software engineering student pursuing MERN Stack Development, which I have always been passionate about. I started practicing and gaining hands-on experience since 2021, which includes learning from resources, developing custom projects, and doing multiple internships at different organizations. Throughout my learning process, I focused on developing custom projects utilizing recommended industrial practices and software development approaches. Moreover, I am a Meta and LinkedIn certified MERN Stack Developer, having obtained certifications from these organizations. As a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, I've had the honor of contributing towards fostering a sense of community among individuals from diverse racial backgrounds. Crafting ideas into web-based realities is my forte, and I strive to deliver beyond the constraints.</b><p/>
