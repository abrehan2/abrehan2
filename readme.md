ABOUT ME

Hello 👋, I'm Rehan, a Senior Software Engineer focused on building scalable software and writing thought-provoking articles. 🚀
  
In 2023, I became a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, a worldwide community of campus influencers driven to assist their peers and cultivate thriving technology ecosystems. Buying premium courses in Pakistan has been a significant challenge for someone belonging to a middle-class family. This motivated me to build a regional community of over 700 people focused on Web Development from different colors, castes, and creeds. I aim to solve this problem by hosting workshops and bootcamps, and to date, I have hosted 30+ workshops.

During my time at university, I always sought ways to use Visual Studio Code during classes. I was the winner of CodeAir, a flagship competitive coding competition held at the university by Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA), among 40+ teams from different universities. Furthermore, I was invited to host a workshop for AI students on 'GitHub - Your Portal to Open Source Excellence' at LTC Hall. Additionally, I served as a Developer Lead in my university's MLSA chapter, where I managed a team of eight people involved in integrating features, carrying out versions, and making updates quickly for each MLSA event. Moreover, I was a Web Development mentor in Developers League, a two-month bootcamp organized by MLSA. I was tasked with conducting workshops on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for juniors to make them aware of different paths to pursue. 

I have released two npm packages: 'use-countries-hook', built with React.js, and 'geospatial-toolkit', built with Node.js. Each carries a distinct purpose and contributes to the developer community.

My expertise: </br>
• 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀: JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python </br>
• 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁-𝗘𝗻𝗱: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, React.js, Redux, Next.js, and Zustand </br> 
• 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸-𝗘𝗻𝗱: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and Web Sockets </br>
• 𝗨𝗜 𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀: Chakra UI, Antd, shadcn/ui, and Aceternity UI </br>
• 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: Postman, Jest, and GitHub
