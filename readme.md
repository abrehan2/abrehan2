ABOUT ME
</h1>	

<div>
<p align="left">
Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rehan, a final-year software engineering student from Air University, Islamabad. Since 2021, I have been gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development by learning from various resources and developing custom projects according to industrial standards, with a particular focus on software development. I have always been intrigued by open-source contributions and have enabled myself to contribute beyond the constraints.<br><br>
Crafting ideas into web-based realities is my forte, which enables me to possess the following skills:<br>
â€¢ <b>Programming Languages:</b> JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python<br>
â€¢ <b>Front-End:</b> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js, Redux, Next.js, Chakra UI, Material UI, and Antd<br>
â€¢ <b>Back-End:</b> Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and REST APIs<br>
â€¢ <b>Tools:</b> Postman, Netlify, and Vercel<br><br>
Furthermore, I am a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, which fosters my involvement in a diverse community of individuals belonging to different races and sharing different experiences. I have been engaged in consulting people, helping them get started with web development by hosting hands-on workshops on React.js, REST APIs, and several others. Similarly, I'm also a Postman Student Expert, which demonstrates my expertise in API testing.
