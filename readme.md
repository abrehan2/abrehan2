ABOUT ME
</h1>	
 
<p align="left"><b>Greetings, fellow ambassadors! I am a third-year software engineering student who is passionate about pursuing MERN Stack Development. I have been gaining hands-on experience since 2021 by practicing and learning from various resources, developing custom projects, and adhering to recommended industrial practices comprising software development approaches. In addition, I am a certified MERN Stack Developer, having obtained certifications from Meta and LinkedIn. As a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, I have had the honor of contributing to fostering a sense of community among individuals from diverse racial backgrounds. I am also a Postman Student Expert, which demonstrates my expertise in API testing with Postman. Crafting ideas into web-based realities is my forte, and I strive to deliver beyond the constraints.</b><p/>
